      Hi, my name is Max Hamulyák, and I'd like to welcome you to my website. I am a Software Engineer in the Netherlands, presently employed by Lateral Group. In my spare time, I also like to blog on Kaylumah, a company I founded in 2020.

      You'll find the ideas, thoughts, experiments and ramblings I wanted to share. Most directly inspired by experiences during my career. The main focuses of the blog are .NET, quality and testing. All opinions on these pages are solely my own. They are not shared, supported or endorsed by my employers, present or past. If you see anything you like, feel free to contact me.
