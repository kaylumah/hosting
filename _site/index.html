          I founded Kaylumah in 2020 as my side-business. It enabled me to pursue my
          projects and goals. At the moment, it is not my goal to be fully
          self-employed, but having my own company and branding will serve as an
          enabler.

          Since I am from 1995 and graduated from my bachelor HBO-ICT in 2016, I am
          still in the early stages of my career. After my graduate internship at a
          company then called QNH, now ilionx, I was lucky enough to get a mentor that
          opened my eyes. His message sounded deep within me. I realised that it
          should also be part of my company slogan: "Building a solid solution is more
          important than the technology used".

          So what can you find on my website? You can find information about me,
          projects that I have worked on, and my company. I also think it is time to
          pay it forward. So I decided to start blogging. I will share lessons
          learned, experiments done. Feel free to reach out and contact me. Let me
          know if I can help you, and what you think about my ramblings.
