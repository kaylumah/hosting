      Hi, my name is Max Hamulyák, and I'd like to welcome you to my website. I am a Software Engineer in the Netherlands, presently employed by Lateral Group. In my spare time, I also like to blog on Kaylumah, a company I founded in 2020.

      You'll find the ideas, thoughts, experiments and ramblings I wanted to share. Most directly inspired by experiences during my career. The main focuses of the blog are .NET, quality and testing. All opinions on these pages are solely my own. They are not shared, supported or endorsed by my employers, present or past. If you see anything you like, feel free to contact me.

          I founded Kaylumah in 2020 as my side-business. It enabled me to pursue my
          projects and goals. At the moment, it is not my goal to be fully
          self-employed, but having my own company and branding will serve as an
          enabler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I am from 1995 and graduated from my bachelor HBO-ICT in 2016, I am
          still in the early stages of my career. After my graduate internship at a
          company then called QNH, now ilionx, I was lucky enough to get a mentor that
          opened my eyes. His message sounded deep within me. I realised that it
          should also be part of my company slogan: "Building a solid solution is more
          important than the technology used".
        </p>

          So what can you find on my website? You can find information about me,
          projects that I have worked on, and my company. I also think it is time to
          pay it forward. So I decided to start blogging. I will share lessons
          learned, experiments done. Feel free to reach out and contact me. Let me
          know if I can help you, and what you think about my ramblings.
