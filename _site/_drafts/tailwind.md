# Intro
For years there has been a single aspect of front-end development that I didn't enjoy. That is writing css.
Hate may be a strong word, so let say I had a strong dislike against writing css. Then along came [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com){: .external }.


# Installing

```sh
npm init -y
npm install tailwindcss
```
