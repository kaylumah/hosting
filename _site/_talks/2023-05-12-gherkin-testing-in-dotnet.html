At the 11th edition of the ilionx DevDays in Arnhem, I gave an introductory session on using Gherkin-based testing in .NET with SpecFlow.
I shared practical insights with colleagues and peers on how SpecFlow helps structure tests, making them more human-readable and reusable.
The talk served as an introduction to the Gherkin language and demonstrated how to implement its principles using the SpecFlow framework.
