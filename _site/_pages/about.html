    I will talk a bit about myself, my relevant working history, and which certifications I have achieved on this page. Of course, most of my working history is also available over at LinkedIn.

        <p>
            People describe me as passionate and eager in my working life; they say I can pick up new stuff quickly. You might not expect it since I also blog in my spare time; I am not always working on my technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among other things, I love to read (or listen) to an epic fantasy novel. I listen to film music and occasionally join discussions online. In my downtime, I also enjoy movies or tv series. If any time left, I also enjoy casual gaming.

            Curriculum vitae
        </h3>
        <p class="mt-2 max-w-4xl text-sm text-gray-500">Below is a list of the projects I have done over the year. So far, I worked with two different companies. After finishing my internship with NLCom in 2016, I worked there for a year part-time. For my graduate internship, I chose the consultancy company QNH and ended up working there. I continued working there after the merger with ilionx. Some of the projects were in-house, and some were on a consultancy basis.</p>
