    I will talk a bit about myself, my relevant working history, and which certifications I have achieved on this page. Of course, most of my working history is also available over at LinkedIn.

        <p>
            People describe me as passionate and eager in my working life; they say I can pick up new stuff quickly. You might not expect it since I also blog in my spare time; I am not always working on my technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among other things, I love to read (or listen) to an epic fantasy novel. I listen to film music and occasionally join discussions online. In my downtime, I also enjoy movies or tv series. If any time left, I also enjoy casual gaming.

            Certifications
        </h3>
        <p class="mt-2 max-w-4xl text-sm text-gray-500">I do not believe that certifications add a lot. They don't prove that I know something, just that I knew something at the moment of the test. I would instead look at someone's CV and see the years of experience with a particular skill. However, since this is my portfolio website, I decided to include them.</p>
