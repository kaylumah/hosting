                People describe me as passionate and eager in my working life; they say I can pick up new stuff quickly. You might not expect it since I also blog in my spare time; I am not always working on my technical skills.

                Among other things, I love to read (or listen) to an epic fantasy novel. I listen to film music and occasionally join discussions online. In my downtime, I also enjoy movies or tv series. If any time left, I also enjoy casual gaming.
