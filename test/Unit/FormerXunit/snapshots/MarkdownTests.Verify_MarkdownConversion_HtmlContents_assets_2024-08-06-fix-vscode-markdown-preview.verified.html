<p>Many static website generators support writing blogs in Markdown. Jekyll and several other generators organize content, such as blog posts, and assets, like images and CSS files, into separate directories.</p>
<p>My favorite editor for writing Markdown is VSCode. While this separation is useful for organization, it can be somewhat cumbersome when editing and previewing Markdown.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, let’s look at an example. A typical directory structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># generated with the command tree -L 2
.
├── _posts
│   └── hello-world.md
├── assets
│   └── logo.svg
└── index.html
</code></pre>
<p>Using the Markdown preview feature of VSCode that would look like this:</p>
<!-- code --profile "Blog" . -->

<h2 id="the-issue"><a href="#the-issue">The issue</a></h2>
<p>If you’re like me, your project contains many more files than the few shown in the example. In such cases, I prefer working inside the _posts folder. Unfortunately, as the screenshot below shows, this breaks the image preview functionality.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://kaylumah.nl/assets/images/posts/20240806/markdown-preview/002_FolderPreview.png.webp" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://kaylumah.nl/assets/images/posts/20240806/markdown-preview/002_FolderPreview.png" width="2272" height="1760" alt="Markdown preview from subfolder" /></picture></p>
<p>Instead of displaying my logo, the preview now shows a broken image icon. Technically, this behavior is correct because, relative to our “hello-world.md” post, there is no “assets” directory. You might think that changing the path to “../assets/” would solve the issue, since that’s where the folder exists on disk. However, VSCode does not allow this due to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64685#issuecomment-446414622" class="external">security concerns</a>. Even if it did work, it would create the issue that the preview would no longer function correctly when opened from the root directory.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution"><a href="#the-solution">The solution</a></h2>
<p>To my knowledge, there is no built-in function in VSCode to address this issue. However, there is an operating system-level solution: using symbolic links.</p>
<p>We can create a symlink by running the following command inside the &quot;_posts&quot; directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ln -s ../assets assets
</code></pre>
<p>From the filesystem perspective the &quot;_posts&quot; folder now has a subfolder called posts. If we now open it inside VSCode it renders the image correctly.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe its a nice workaround for an issue that irritated me.
Before you leave I like to leave you with some final thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>This behavior is disabled by default, to prevent opening untrusted content. So don't blindly apply this solution everywhere</li>
<li>If your blog is under source control via GIT you can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/954560/how-does-git-handle-symbolic-links/18791647#18791647" class="external">include those symlinks</a> in GIT so your teammates have the same benefits.
