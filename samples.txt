	"description": "I have decided to pick up blogging again. I wrote a blog post in September 2019 on GitHooks in the past that you can find here. At the time, I decided to use the platform Medium to voice my thoughts. After I tweeted too @shanselman I got way more views on the article then I had expected. So when in 2020, I decided to found Kaylumah, I knew I wanted more than just a regular portfolio website. Since I am learning a lot from my mentor over at ilionx, I want to share lessons learned and start building my brand and identity.",
